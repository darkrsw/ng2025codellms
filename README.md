# Welcome to the 2025 Next Generation of CodeLLMs and Their Applications

Over the last decade, code generation techniques have rapidly grown at a tremendous rate, on the basis of large language models (LLMs).
Today, we stand at the frontier of a new era where CodeLLMs are not just tools for code generation and completion, but intelligent collaborators capable of reasoning, debugging, and co-designing complex software systems.

This event brings together leading researchers and practitioners who are shaping the next generation of AI-powered Software Engineering.
We invite distinguished speakers from around the world, each bringing innovative perspectives and groundbreaking ideas to advance the frontiers of CodeLLM research and intelligent software development.

We hope you enjoy the state-of-the-art research, inspiring new ideas, and valuable opportunities to connect with fellow researchers throughout this workshop !!!
